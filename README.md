# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that can lead to unexpected or incorrect results.  The issue stems from a misconfiguration within the aggregation pipeline stages, causing the final results to differ from the intended outcome. The solution provides a corrected pipeline.

## Bug Description

The provided aggregation pipeline intends to group documents based on a specific field, count the occurrences of each group, sort the results in descending order of count, and limit the output to the top 10. However, due to a potential flaw in either the `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, or `$limit` stage, the pipeline produces inaccurate results.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates the correct aggregation pipeline for achieving the desired results. The updated pipeline includes necessary changes to ensure the pipeline correctly groups, sorts, and limits the results.
